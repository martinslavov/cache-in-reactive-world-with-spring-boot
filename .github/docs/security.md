# Security and permissions

Least-privilege rules for workflows, tokens and agents (EPIC #119, task 2.4, issue #118).

## Workflow permissions

Every workflow sets `permissions: {}` at the top level; each job declares only the grants it needs.

| Workflow | Job | Job permissions | Secrets used |
|----------|-----|-----------------|--------------|
| `ci-unit-tests.yml` | `unit-tests` | `contents: read` | none |
| `ci-component-tests.yml` | `component-tests` | `contents: read` | `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (login step only, before checkout) |
| `ci-sanity-tests.yml` | `sanity-tests` | `contents: read` | `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (login step only, before checkout) |
| `ci-static-review.yml` | `static-review` | `contents: read` | none |
| `ci-secret-scan.yml` | `secret-scan` | `contents: read` | none |
| `ci-dependency-review.yml` | `dependency-review` | `contents: read` | none |
| `ci-code-review.yml` (CodeQL) | `analyze` | `contents: read`, `actions: read`, `security-events: write` | none |
| `ci-agent-dashboard.yml` | `update-dashboard` | `contents: read`, `pull-requests: read`, `issues: write` | none |
| `ci-pr-issue-tracking.yml` | `create-issue` | `contents: read`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write` | `PROJECT_TOKEN` (board step only) |
| `ci-pr-issue-close.yml` | `close-issue` | `contents: read`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: read` | `PROJECT_TOKEN` (board step only) |
| `ci-issue-board.yml` | `add-to-board` | none (`permissions: {}`) | `PROJECT_TOKEN` |
| `ci-tag.yml` | `plan` | `contents: read`, `pull-requests: read` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (read-only; checks out and runs the release helper) |
| `ci-tag.yml` | `tag` | `contents: write` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (create tag; no checkout, runs no repository code) |
| `ci-tag.yml` | `release` caller | `contents: write`, `packages: write` | Reusable-workflow permission ceiling; forwards Docker Hub secrets only to CI Release |
| `ci-release.yml` | `resolve`, `build` | `contents: read` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (validate tag and fetch source) |
| `ci-release.yml` | `publish` | `contents: read`, `packages: write` | `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (registry logins in publish steps only) |
| `ci-release.yml` | `release` | `contents: write` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (create/update notes and attach jar only for a new release) |
| `ci-release.yml` | `latest` | `contents: read`, `packages: write` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (alias the highest stable image) |
| `ci-release.yml` | `prune` | `contents: write`, `packages: write` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (delete stale package versions before releases/tags) |

`ci-tag.yml` writes a tag only for a merged PR targeting `main`; the push fallback verifies that the commit is associated
with a merged PR from a fork. It does not execute PR code. Privilege is separated: the read-only `plan` job looks up the PR and calculates the tag with the checked-out helper, while the `contents: write` `tag` job does not check out the repository or run repository scripts. It treats the plan outputs as untrusted: the tag must match strict stable SemVer `^v(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)$`, the bump must be `major`, `minor` or `patch`, and the commit (taken from the event context, never from a job output) must be a 40-hex SHA that exists in the repository. It recomputes the version from the live tags on each attempt, so a plan that raced or went stale cannot allocate a wrong or duplicate version, and returns the existing tag when the commit is already tagged. The mutating jobs (`ci-tag.yml` `tag`, and `ci-release.yml` `publish`, `release`, `latest` and `prune`) use the
job-level `release-tag` concurrency group with `queue: max` and no cancellation. This keeps tag pushes, image/release
updates, latest alias movement and cleanup serialized without a workflow-level group that could block a reusable call.
The `ci-tag.yml` reusable-workflow caller grants the maximum `contents: write`/`packages: write` permissions required by
CI Release and explicitly passes only the two Docker Hub secrets; each called job still declares its own narrower token
permissions, and only the publisher references those secrets in its registry-login steps.
CI Release accepts only an existing strict stable `vX.Y.Z` tag (including `workflow_dispatch` backfills), resolves it to
a commit, builds/tests at that immutable commit, and passes only the same-run jar and health-check class to its image job.
The `publish` job alone receives Docker Hub secrets; it logs out of `dhi.io` and `ghcr.io` on every exit and verifies
credentials are absent. It reuses an existing image only after checking its OCI revision matches the tag commit. Release
notes are updated idempotently with the image reference/digest and existing jar assets are not replaced. The separate
`latest` job selects the numerically greatest stable release and retags that exact manifest.

The `prune` job has no checkout and runs no repository helper or Python. It lists stable tags and package versions,
protects retained versions and every shared/non-stale package tag, and deletes eligible image versions before deleting
release/tag metadata. If the package API cannot be read or image deletion is denied (including plans that do not permit
GITHUB_TOKEN version deletion), it fails visibly and keeps the release/tag; there is no PAT fallback. The owner must
review package Actions access/deletion capability before relying on automatic image pruning. The tag job dereferences
annotated Git tags before checking whether the merge commit already has a tag.

Checkout steps use `persist-credentials: false`, so the job token is not left in `.git/config` while build and test
code runs. `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run` are not used; do not add them without a separate security review,
because they run with secrets and a write token.

### Docker registry credential boundary

`docker/login-action` stores registry credentials in the runner Docker config (`~/.docker/config.json`), where later
steps could read them; `persist-credentials: false` does not affect this config.

Component and sanity tests keep Docker Hub credentials away from PR-controlled code:

1. Log in to `dhi.io` only when the read-only Docker Hub secrets are available.
2. Pull the fixed image list in `DHI_IMAGES`, defined in the workflow itself (not read from the Dockerfile or other PR
   files); `test_workflow_security.py` keeps it aligned with Dockerfile `FROM` lines.
3. Run `docker logout dhi.io` with `if: always()` and fail if `dhi.io` remains under `auths` or `credHelpers`.
4. Only then check out repository code and run the build/tests. Compose reuses the already pulled base image without
   `--pull`; PostgreSQL and Redis are pulled anonymously.

For releases, the `publish` job checks out the selected validated tag with `persist-credentials: false` and downloads
only this run's build artifact before either registry login. Docker Hub and GHCR credentials are scoped to this job;
`dhi.io` and `ghcr.io` are logged out on all exits, then the config is checked for residual credentials. The separate
`latest` publisher also logs out of GHCR and verifies cleanup. Neither release job checks out untrusted PR code; the
image build uses only the validated release tag.
The package must be linked to the repository for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` package API access to work. A user-owned GHCR package
may start private; the owner must make it public once in package settings to allow anonymous pulls. Package-version
deletion may not be enabled for user-owned packages on every plan. In that case pruning fails closed before deleting the
corresponding release/tag and asks the owner to grant package-version deletion access; there is no PAT fallback.

No PR-controlled code (make, Gradle, scripts or Compose) runs while component/sanity test credentials are stored. The
workflow files are still part of same-repository PRs, so changes to these secret-handling steps require review like any
other security-sensitive changes.

## SHA pinning and Dependabot

- Every `uses:` reference is pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA with the release tag as a trailing comment,
  e.g. `actions/checkout@<sha> # v7.0.1`. Tags are mutable, SHAs are not.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` enables the `github-actions` ecosystem (directory `/`, weekly), so Dependabot opens PRs that
  bump the SHA and the version comment. Review these PRs like code changes (release notes, new permissions).
- Resolve a SHA with `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/ref/tags/<tag>`; for an annotated tag (`type: tag`) dereference
  it with `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/tags/<sha>` and use the commit SHA.

## Fork pull requests

Workflows triggered by `pull_request` from a fork get a read-only token and no repository secrets.

- Nothing runs PR code with secrets or a write token (no `pull_request_target` / `workflow_run`).
- Component and sanity tests check whether the Docker Hub secrets exist and skip only the login and base-image
  pull steps when they do not; the build, `make up` and the tests still run (a missing login is never a reason to skip
  tests). Hardened-image (`dhi.io`) pulls may fail without credentials; the job then fails visibly instead of passing.
- Dependabot PRs get Dependabot secrets, not Actions secrets; the same rule applies.
- PR Issue Tracking cannot create issues for fork PRs (read-only token).

## Token scopes

| Secret | Used by | Minimum scope |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `PROJECT_TOKEN` | `ci-issue-board.yml`, `ci-pr-issue-tracking.yml`, `ci-pr-issue-close.yml` (GraphQL: read the user project `RCAS Tracking`, add items, update the `Status` field) | Fine-grained personal access token owned by the project owner, **user permission "Projects": read and write**; no repository permissions are needed because issue and PR access comes from the job `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Set a short expiry and rotate. |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | `ci-component-tests.yml`, `ci-sanity-tests.yml` (base-image pull) and `ci-release.yml` `publish` (image build) | Docker Hub access token with **read-only (public repo read)** permission. Never a password or a read/write token. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | all workflows | Per job, see the table above. For GHCR, `packages: write` is limited to publication, `latest`, and prune jobs; no personal access token is used. |

Secrets are exposed only to the step that needs them, never at workflow or job level.

## Agent permissions

Agents run locally under the user's `gh` identity; `tools:` in `.github/agents/*.agent.md` limits the editor tooling,
it does not replace GitHub authorization. Separate identities per agent are deferred (#114, `requires-pro`).

| Agent | `tools:` | May change |
|-------|----------|------------|
| `product-owner-agent` | read, search, execute | Creates/updates GitHub issues only; no code |
| `architect-agent` | read, search, execute | Issue comments and the approval label only; no code |
| `senior-java-software-engineer` | read, edit, search, execute | Source, tests, docs and workflows on a `feature/*` branch; opens the PR; sets only `pending` agent statuses; merges only when every gate passes |
| `pr-review-agent` | read, search, execute | PR comments and the `PR Review` status; no code |
| `senior-qa-engineer` | read, edit, search, execute | Adds or improves tests on the PR branch (`edit` is needed for that), PR comments, the `QA Agent` status; no production code |
| `dod-validator-agent` | read, search, execute | PR comments and the `Definition of Done` status; no code |

Analysing agents (product owner, architect, PR review, DoD) already have no `edit` tool, so `tools:` was left unchanged.
`execute` is required by all agents because they use the `gh` CLI.
